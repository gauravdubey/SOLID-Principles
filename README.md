# SOLID-Principles

The SOLID principles are five design principles that help in writing maintainable, scalable, and testable software. They are particularly useful in object-oriented programming.

# ðŸ”¥ SOLID Principles Overview
1.  S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2.  O â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3.  L â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4.  I â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5.  D â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
- âœ… SRP: Each class should have only one reason to change.
- âœ… OCP: Extend functionality via new classes, donâ€™t modify existing ones.
- âœ… LSP: Subtypes must be replaceable without breaking the program.
- âœ… ISP: Create small, focused interfaces instead of one large interface.
- âœ… DIP: Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations.
